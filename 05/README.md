05 make re-usable, linear breaks, quantize scale 

this iteration uses [quantize](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#quantize-scales) scale with naive linear breaks to map values in the data to colors on the choropleth map

it also:

- updates variable handling as well to make the map code re-usable

- improve path stroke styling
